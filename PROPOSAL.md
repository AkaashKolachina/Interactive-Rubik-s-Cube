**Project Proposal**

I would like to build a 3d 3x3 Rubik’s cube in Cinder. I would like this Rubik’s Cube to be fully animated and functional. 
I would also like to include pre-programmed patterns that the cube can execute.(E.g a series of turns that make the cube look like a checkerboard.)
Lastly, I want the cube to be able to take in input from the user so that the user can add whatever pattern they want as well as theoretically scramble and solve the cube.

While I have no experience working with 3d graphics, I am really interested in twisty puzzles. I have been fascinated with the Rubik’s cube since middle school. From then on, I have purchased dozens of twisty puzzles, wrote my own solution to the 3x3, and even wrote one of my college essays about twisty puzzles. When I first started learning how to code a few years ago, one of the first projects I wanted to do was make a Rubik’s cube solver. While that project has always been a bit out of reach for me, making a robust visualization of the cube will be a good potential first step in eventually making a Rubik’s cube solver.

I plan to have a decent rendering of the Rubik’s cube by the end of week one. The cube will likely be static at this point, but it should be designed in a way such that I can implement turn functionality without having to change the overall design and model of the cube. I plan to have the turn functionality done by week two. At this point I should be able to display a cube that can be turned in all the possible ways a Rubik’s cube can be turned. These turns do not have to be dictated by user input yet, instead they can be loaded in at compile time. By the end of week 3, I should have several patterns pre-programmed into the application. I should also be able to trigger turns from user input.

My ultimate Blue Sky delivery would be adding in some type of A.I that can actually solve the cube in any way the user scrambles. This is highly unrealistic as implementing this would likely be more difficult then the entirety of the actual project. A more realistic stretch goal would be adding a scramble button or keyword that randomly scrambles the cube, I can then have a “solve” button or keyword that gives the illusion of solving the cube by just reversing the scramble. Another possible stretch goal would be to have my app be able to render any valid size Rubik’s cube (2x2 to 7x7).
